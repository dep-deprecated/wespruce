      This platform enables you to quickly and easily clean your own home town. Report and fix problems,
      earn points and compete to be the best do-gooder in your town!

      It works by enabling users to report <strong>problem spots</strong> within their community.
      With the power of <strong>Google Maps</strong>, users can report problems right in their
      own home town. Then, other users can see those problems, fix them, and after they report
      them as done, they get points. More points means more achievements. The more you participate,
      the higher your score. Interact with other locals through comments, photos, and profiles!
